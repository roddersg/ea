                    <p>The EA 2018 tryouts were held on the 3rd-5th September.  This page serves as a journal of what happened during these 3 days and the results of the competition among the groups</p>
                    
                    <h3>Icebreaker</h3>
                    <p>The day started with a fast 30 minute construction between teams to see who could build the strongest bridge which could span a 30cm gap between tables using only ice-cream sticks and a glue gun.  There were amazingly many designs of which 3 were totally outstanding.</p>
