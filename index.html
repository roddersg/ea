                    <p>Welcome to the 2018 <b>Engineering Academy</b> Tryouts!</p>
                    <p>This is an example web-site that the students have to create in the process of the try-outs.  At a minimum, the site will need a write-up of similar to this site.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2018, the tryouts will be held at T1441-43 Fablab EA from the 4th-6th September.  In the course of the 3 days they will be asked to conceive, design and build a micro-controlled project that performs a particular task.</p>
                    <p><b>Staff members</b> act as facilitators and will provide ideas and guidance but no actual help in the creation of the project.  They may provide answers, suggestions and direction but may not help in the construction.  Stff should also refrain from debugging whole project code but can provide ideas on where to find the solution.</p>
                    <p><b>Students</b> will work in teams of <b>4</b> and will have to<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a blog to record activities</li>
                            <li>Learn simple construction and development, microcontroller programming and interfacing and testing</li>
                            <li>Cooperation and teamwork</li>
                            <li>Review and reflect on the work they have done</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end of the tryouts, students will be evaluated using a rubric consisting of
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teamwork</li>
                            <li>Initiative</li>
                            <li>Creativity</li>

                            <li>Peer review</li>
                        </ul>
                        Selected students will be eligible to apply for the Engineering Academy program in Session 2019/20
                    </p>
                    <p>There will be a competition at the end of the 3 days with prizes for the winning teams, this will be announced on the 3rd day.
